<center><u>MY ACHIEVEMENT<u><center>
<pr>Achievement is an award for completing a particular task or meeting an objective,it is a successful
acomplishment,looking back the years it has been amazing but the one i can never forget which i term as a 
notable achievement was while i was in ss3<br>
<pr>i am Adedunmade,one of the few people look up to back then in secondary school,because i broke the
unbreakable record.I was very good at sporting activicities especially track events,i keep training to be 
outstanding in what i do<br>
<pr>A well known competition inwhich most known secondary schools participate is around the corner and everyone
is preparing for the competition.I devoted my time,energy and prayers there just to make sure i make my
school proud.To God be the glory as luck found me and i was the best athlete in over 500schools that 
gathered for the competition<br>
<pr>Indeed it is an achievement that bring smile on my face.
